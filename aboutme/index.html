    <h2>Andrea</h2>
    <p>My name is Andrea Toreki. I am originally from Hungary, Europe, but have lived in California, USA the past 7 years with minor and major interruptions since health-related issues.
</p>
<p>My major is Marketing and Business, my undergraduate degree is in Marketing and Economics, and my master's degree is a business MBA with a project management specialization. I am currently pursuing the Applied Technologies Bachelor program at BYU Idaho. This is my very first semester.
</p>
<p>I've been happily married to a wonderful man for over a year, but we've been together for 13 years. We now have the best four-legged child ever, but we hope to start a family soon.</p>
<p>As a lead, I have been working on a Google project at Search Ads team with a vendor company. Every day, I work with hundreds of websites and advertisements as a marketer.
    Because I am more on the marketing side and have no prior experience of coding, I frequently struggled to grasp certain technical problems at work. Coding is obviously not required for my job, but I am very interested in it and want to learn more about the other side, including software development, web design, and UI/UX design in the future. 
    I am confident that this curriculum will be extremely valuable to me, and I believe that my leadership and marketing skills would be a great fit with web design and programming.
    </p>
    <p>My hobbies are hiking, reading, photography, singing, wall climbing, yoga, and badminton.</p>
    <p>I am very excited and look forward to learning about coding.</p>
